# Agentic Assistant

## Description

An intelligent AI assistant that helps with everyday work and academic tasks. Users interact with it like GPT, but the agent is specifically equipped to handle email management, calendar operations, and other productivity tasks.

Note: This project is still in progress. This is project is being done wiht little to no AI for code generation. This is a project to help me learn fullstack development as well as langgraph, langchain, and other APIs.

**Capabilities:**

- General LLM capabilities with conversation memory
- Email management (read, analyze, and create drafts)
- Calendar integration (create meetings, manage events)
- RAG capabilities with vector database storage
- Interactive chat interface with saved conversation history

## Current Implementation Status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Google Cloud Console account
- Anthropic API key

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
   - Download `credentials.json` from Google Cloud Console
   - Place in project root
4. Create `.env` file with:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. Run the application: `python main.py`

### Usage
- Start interactive chat: The application will prompt for user input
- Ask about emails: "What are my unread emails?"
- Create drafts: "Create drafts for my unread emails"
- Exit: Type "exit", "quit", or "bye"

## Development Status

This project is actively under development. The core email management system is fully functional, with the AI agent capable of:
- Reading and analyzing emails
- Determining which emails need responses
- Creating professional email drafts
- Saving drafts to Gmail

The next phases will focus on frontend development, calendar integration, and RAG capabilities.

## Contributing

This is a personal project currently in active development. The codebase is well-documented and modular, making it suitable for future contributions and extensions.
